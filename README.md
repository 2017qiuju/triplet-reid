# Triplet-based Person Re-Identification
Code for reproducing the results of our "In Defense of the Triplet Loss for Person Re-Identification" paper.

# Publication Pending!
The publication of all code is pending acceptance of the paper. Since we've been asked several times, this work was a submission to ICCV'17 and you can have look at the [timeline](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com/submission/timeline), so if all goes well, code will come online sometime this summer.
